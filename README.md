Make sure you are on your profile under "following".
Scroll down as far as you wish, then copy/paste this script into the web console.

It will pause for a random amount of seconds (greater than 2) between each action.
This is in order to not be spammy on the Twitter network.
Random time varies between 1 and a number of seconds set by the user.

Twitter does not like mass unfollowing (or following) and will lock your account.
To many lock outs and you could get your account banned.

How to do the thing:
Open https://twitter/following
Open the dev console (ctrl + shift + J or cmd + shift + J on Mac)
Highlight and copy the code from 'unfollow.js'
Paste the copied code into your dev console then unfollow! :)
